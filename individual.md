# OSO CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT (Individual)

Thank you for contributing your code to Oso Security, Inc (“oso”, “we”, “us”).
We ask every contributor to agree to this Contributor License Agreement (“CLA”)
in order to clarify what rights are being given to us. Please note that this is
a license, not a transfer of ownership. Aside from the rights you grant us, you
retain all rights to your contributions, including ownership. If you wish to go
ahead with your contribution, please fill out the fields at the end of this
agreement and sign it.

1. **Submission**. A contribution is any material that you submit to oso so
   that we may include it in our products and/or in any applicable
   documentation (individually, “oso Product”, and, collectively, “oso
   Products”). You may submit your contributions via GitHub, email, and/or
   Slack.

2. **Copyright License**. By submitting your contribution, you hereby grant to
   oso and to all entities who use oso Products a worldwide, perpetual,
   irrevocable, non-exclusive license to reproduce, create derivative works
   from, publicly display and perform, sublicense, and distribute your
   contribution and any such derivative works.

3. **Patent License**. You also hereby grant to oso and anyone using oso’s
   Products a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive patent license
   to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
   any oso Product that contains or utilizes your contribution, where such
   license applies only to those patent claims licensable by you that are
   necessarily infringed by your contribution, whether alone or by combining
   your contribution with an oso Product or oso Products. In the event an
   entity initiates patent litigation against you or any other entity
   (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) on the grounds that
   your contribution or that the oso Product to which you have contributed
   constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, any patent licenses
   granted to that entity under this agreement for that contribution and/or for
   that oso Product shall terminate as of the date such litigation commences.

4. **Representations and Warranties**. You represent and warrant that you have
   the authority enter into this agreement and grant the rights set forth in
   this agreement, and that each of your contributions is original to you and
   will not infringe any third party’s rights. In the event your contribution
   or any part thereof is subject to any license, agreement, or third-party
   right, you represent and warrant that you have, to the best of your
   knowledge, disclosed such information to oso. In the event you are an
   employee of an organization, you hereby represent and warrant that either
   (A) your employer has no rights to your contribution or (B) your employer
   has met one or more of the following requisites: your employer (a) has given
   you permission to submit that contribution on its behalf, (b) waived rights
   to the contribution you’re submitting, and/or (c) has entered into a
   separate agreement with oso.

 5. **Third Party Materials**. Please note that, in the event you want to
    submit materials that are not original to you (that is, you didn’t create
    them independently), you may still submit them, but please follow these
    guidelines:

    <ol type="a">
      <li>submit such materials separately from any contribution;</li>
      <li>identify the party on whose behalf you are submitting such
      materials;</li>
      <li>identify the materials’ source;</li>
      <li>identify any and all applicable restrictions; and</li>
      <li>provide all relevant licensing information.</li>
    </ol><br>

6. **Updates**. In the event any of the information you’ve provided turns out
   to be inaccurate, you will notify oso of the foregoing as soon as is
   commercially reasonable.
